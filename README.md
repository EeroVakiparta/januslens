# JanusLens: Git Visualization Tool

A lightweight, high-performance Git visualization tool built with Tauri and Rust, offering GitKraken-like functionality with superior performance for large repositories.

## üîç Project Overview

JanusLens (named after the Roman god Janus who simultaneously looks to the past and future) provides intuitive visualization of code history and branches. This project aims to be a viable alternative to GitKraken, focusing on core features while providing exceptional performance.

## ‚ö° Key Features (MVP)

- **Repository Visualization**: Interactive, performance-optimized Git graph
- **Advanced Diff Viewer**: Side-by-side comparison with syntax highlighting
- **Commit Management**: Intuitive staging and commit interface
- **Branch/Merge Handling**: Visual branch and merge operations
- **Large Repository Support**: Optimized for performance with enormous codebases

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust + git2 library for high-performance Git operations
- **Framework**: Tauri (Rust-based alternative to Electron with significantly lower memory footprint)
- **Frontend**: Svelte with TypeScript for a reactive UI
- **Visualization**: D3.js for branch graphs

## üí™ Technical Advantages

- **Memory Efficient**: ~10-30x less memory usage than Electron apps
- **Performance**: Rust backend handles heavy Git operations outside the UI thread
- **Smart Loading**: Pagination, virtualization, and chunked processing for large repos
- **Native Integration**: Direct Git operations via Rust's git2 library
